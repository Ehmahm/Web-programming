<p1>This is about me as a data science student and l am in BSDS 1:2.I became passionate about data science after l was introduced to how insights can be achieved from data and how that data can be manipulated.
    Data science is a fairly new field and is only taught at UCU and l started my journey on 2nd May and hope this will be a game changer in my life.

    One of the first things we learned was the importance of data cleaning and preparation. This might sound mundane, but it's a crucial step in the data science process. Without clean and reliable data, any analysis we do will be flawed. We also started exploring different programming languages like Python and R, which are essential tools for data scientists. While it was a bit difficult at first, I'm starting to get the hang of it.

    As we delved deeper into the course, we began to learn about various statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms. It's been a bit mind-boggling to try and grasp all the concepts, but I'm starting to see how these tools can be used to solve real-world problems. I'm particularly interested 
    in the potential applications of data science in fields like healthcare and finance. I can't wait to see what the future holds for this exciting field! <br>
